# COVID-19-Outcome-Prediction
Classification COVID-19 Outcome (if the disease will die or not).
I. Project overview
COVID-19 is the disease caused by the emerging coronavirus called SARS-CoV-2. There are many
symptoms that accompany the disease, but they differ from one person to another according to several
factors such as age. The most common symptoms of COVID-19 are:
 Fever
 dry cough
 stress
Other less common symptoms that may affect some patients include:
 loss of taste and smell,
 Nasal congestion,
 Conjunctivitis (also known as red eyes), etc.
What determines whether a person will die from COVID-19 or not, there are many factors such as age or
severity of symptoms and whether or not he has a chronic disease or not. It turned out that the death rate
among those over 80 years old reached 25%. Doctors discovered that the main cause of death for people
infected with the Corona virus is pneumonia that affects the lungs together, which prevents the body from
obtaining the necessary amount of oxygen, and as a result, the body’s organs stop performing their
functions, and thus the death of the infected person.
Problem Statement
We want to Classification COVID-19 Outcome (if the disease will die or not), we found that
COVID-19 Outcome according to different factors like location, country, age and many symptoms. 
This work will help us to know Covid-19 Outcome (if the disease will die or not) by K-Nearest Neighbors,
Logistic Regression, Naïve Bayes, Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines.
Evaluation Metrics
To evaluate the model, we will use the F1 score (it is a measure of a model’s accuracy on a dataset.
It is used to evaluate binary classification systems, recall (It calculates the data that we expected to be co
rrect out of all the data that we expected to be correct), precision (It determines the percentage of how ac
curate the classifier is in its correct predictions) and accuracy (It determines the number of times the class
ifier's answer was correct).
